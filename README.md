### 📊 Data Science Learning Journey
* Fuelled by curiosity and plenty of unstoppable self-learning — building a solid foundation in data science through structured courses, real-world projects, and graduate study.

#### 🎓 Graduate Studies — Data Science (University of Pittsburgh):
* Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data modeling as core foundations for turning raw data into meaningful insights
* **Math for Data Science**(linear algebra, probability, statistics)\
* **Cloud Computing** (GCP)\
* **Machine Learning, Deep Learning** 
* **LLM and AI Agents**

#### 🧑‍💻 Programming & Tools:
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
* **R** (ggplot2, tidyverse)
* **SQL** (joins, subqueries, CTEs, data modeling)
* **Tableau** (interactive dashboards, visual storytelling)

#### 🧠 CS & AI Foundations:
* **LLM**: built multi-agent systems by using libraries to link specialized agents to an LLM, which uses its underlying neural network layers to turn complex data into coordinated, intelligent actions.

* **IBM Deep Learning Courses**: mastered the development and deployment of deep learning models using Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, gaining hands-on experience in building advanced neural architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers for real-world computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

* CS50x: Computer Science basics (C, Python, data structures, algorithms)
* CS50 Python: OOP, testing, file I/O
* CS50 AI: Search algorithms, logic, basic machine learning
* CS50 SQL: Advanced SQL queries, normalization, database design
